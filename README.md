# mermaid-editor
An editor and viewer for Mermaid UML

It's an [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) shell that hosts a [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) editor along with the heart of the application: The [Mermaid](https://knsv.github.io/mermaid/) UML renderer.

It lets you define UML diagrams with markdown-like syntax.

In its current state, the editor is able to open and save Mermaid (.mmd) files and export PNG images of the finished diagrams. More functionality, like syntax highlighting, support for alternative style sheets, etc. are things I hope to implement as time permits.
